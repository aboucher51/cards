This is, first and foremost, a small exercise in fundamental java. The objective is to produce a library to work with a standard 52-card playing card deck (in addition to a game). This project uses the loose infrastructure for Blackjack, but makes some effort to abstract between intrinsic properties of the cards themselves and properties that Blackjack gives them (ie: Flexible Aces).
